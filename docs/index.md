# Overview

<!--img class="overview-image" src=""-->

To make objects appear to move, we need to draw them over and over -- in a loop -- while changing the object's position, it's X and Y coordinates. In this lesson we'll begin by learning how create a **function** called `draw()` that will be called in an endless loop. The `draw()` loop will be responsible for updating the objects in the scene and then drawing them.
